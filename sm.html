        <h4>Process</h4>
          <p class="child_copy">Sterling had three existing sites that needed to to come into one unified location. Before making any strategic decisions, a baseline understanding had to be set in Discovery about who and what Sterling Corporation is. </p>
          <ul class="child_copy_list">
            <li class="child_copy_list_item"><b>Who is Sterling Corporation?</b> <br>The largest white glove mover and professional logistics provider in New England for homes and offices with capabilities of handling local to cross country relocations of regular to high end commodities.</li>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">At the end of our discovery process we came to a few conclusions that would decide the direction of the rest of the project.</p>
          <ul class="child_copy_list">
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Bringing three websites into one centralized home would be tough, but aligning with the three primary offerings (Logistics Services, Commercial Moving, and Residential Moving) would provide the best paths for our audiences to find what they need.</li>
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Showing visitors that Sterling is one of the longest, most qualified, and well-established moving and logistics companies in New England would help define what we call "The Sterling Difference" conveying value to our visitors.</li>
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Creating a quick, easy, and logical lead submission process on the new Sterling site needed be a staple in the new design. The sales team was confident that as long as they could get potential customers on the phone they could convert them, so leaning into this skill Sterling had on closing deals was a factor in how lead gen was handled on the website.</li>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">Once the sitemap was approved we got to work on some early homepage wireframe iterations.

      What I find helpful when wireframing is making an extremely lightweight page structure using generic page content to highlight text areas and images using large rectangles and shapes to begin to sculpt the shape of the page.</p>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">After the homepage is settled on it becomes a race to iterate on wireframes from the sitemap until the hours are used up. The more wireframes that can be presented to the client the better, especially if the wireframes are connected in a prototype.</p>

      <h4>Result</h4>
      <p class="child_copy">Working on the new Sterling Corportion experience was easily my favorite piece of professional work because it saw our entire UX process (except for personas) through to finish and the development team building the code crushed the build. The client was extremely impressed and they got exactly what they were shown! The website can be seen <a href="https://www.sterlingmoving.com">here.</a>
