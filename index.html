  <p>I'm James, a web design professional currently working at <a href="https://imarc.com/">Imarc</a> as a UX Strategist.</p>
  <p>I am curious about the intersection of design and communication between people. I believe in design that supports a universal language understood by all users and ultimately makes an impact. I craft customer-focused user experiences that help clients exceed their business goals to serve their target audiences on the web. My guiding principle of quality, a commitment to collaboration within teams, and a daily dedication to improvement is what sets me apart from my peers. Outside of my day to day work, I am passionate about running, augmented reality, endurance motorsport, and visual storytelling.</p>
