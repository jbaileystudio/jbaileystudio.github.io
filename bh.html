      <h4>Objective</h4>  
        <p class="child_copy">Bright Horizons was seeking to improve one of their many lead generation processes by iterating on their child care center location tool. The old experience was unfriendly to mobile devices, provided minimal clarity to users in areas where there are a ot of child care centers, and wasn't built on a system that could be updated easily.</p>
      </div>
    <div class="child_copy_block">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p id="child_copy_list">The solution was broken into three core parts: 
          <ul class="child_copy_list">
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Create a map powered by Google Maps to align with the industry standard for location services</li>
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Optimize the design to service desktop and mobile better devices regardless of device size</li>
            <li class="child_copy_list_item">Provide child care center location details on click/tap for quicker highlight information.</li>
          </ul>

      <h4>Process</h4>
        <p class="child_copy">The hardest part of improving the locator tool was determining which improvement would make the most impact to the user base. The old locator tool was forcing users to locate their nearest location via a massive full screen map and a tiny ZIP code box that was attached to an infinite scrolling results list.</p>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">To create the largest improvement for our users we needed to ensure the largest possible audience could use the tool in the first place regardless of wich device they were on. This led us to separating the search and results list from its old location overlaying the map.</p>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">Adding essential information to the existing map pins was the lowest hanging fruit for improvement. Map users of the internet today are familiar with the mental model of pins and we opted to lean into that by adding only the essential pieces of information parents need to know was as a way to declutter the overall design and lighten up the search results.</p>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">After internal review we determined that while the presentation of the map and its results was in a better spot than before, the vertical split of map and search results was too closely mirroring the previous iteration and was ultimately still limiting mobile visitors control.

      Therefore a decision was made to approach the map and search tools in a horizontal 50/50 split of the page with a much lighter landing experience for new visitors. This would lead into a more refined filtering results page with a double set of cards and a lot more visual room to massage information around that is friendlier to different device types.</p>

  <div class="child_copy_block_2">
    <div class="page_content">
      <p class="child_copy">Upon final review we scrapped the early introductary search screens as they took up too many clicks for the user and we wanted to plant the visitor directly into the map experience instead. This became an incredibly streamlined flow for the user as they could now immediately search for their location or choose pins upon initial arrival. Additionally the presentation of multiple cards on screen along with sophisticated filtering gives the user maximum control without detracting from the initial purpose of visit.</p>

      <p class="child_copy">We knew we were on the right track when the mobile wireframes flow could still operate naturally as a map, search and results page all at the same time without detracting from the overall goal of finding a center.</p>
